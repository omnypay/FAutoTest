## Acknowledgements

FAutoTest continues to recruit contributors, even if you answer questions in Issues or help answer questions in the group, or do some simple bugfix, it will help FAutoTest.

FAutoTest has been developed for nearly half a year. I would like to thank all developers for their love and support for FAutoTest. I hope that you can become a core contributor to FAutoTest and join FAutoTest to create a better and better UI automation test framework.

We collect issues and feature-related support needs through Github Issues.

## Pull Requests
We look forward to your FAutoTest being improved through PR (Pull Requests).

### Branch Management
The warehouse contains two branches:

`master` branch
  1. ** Do not submit any PRs on the master branch. **
2. `dev` branch
  1. The `dev` branch acts as a stable development branch and will be merged into the `master` branch in the next version after testing.
  2. **PR should be submitted on the `dev` branch. **

### PR Process
The FAutoTest team will look at all the PRs. We will run some code checks and tests. Once tested, we will accept the PR, but will not immediately merge the code onto the master branch with some delay.

When you prepare your PR, make sure you have completed the following steps:

1. Make the warehouse fork and create your development branch based on the `dev` branch.
2. Update the code and documentation if you have changed the APIs.
3. Add a copyright notice to the header of each new file you add.
4. Check your code syntax and format.
5. Test repeatedly.
6. Now you can start PR on the `dev` branch.
